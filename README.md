## Welcome To Cucumber

This is a demo portal which acts as an interface to the Cucumber API.

To run it:

- Move Gruntfile.js.default to Gruntfile.js
- Move local.env.sample.js.default to local.env.sample.js
- Create an Application in the current Tony and obtain your APP ID and Secret
- Enter these in the local.enc.sample.js.default. Or use some ENV variables.

To run, you can try something like this:

CT_URL=api.ctapp.io npm start

And the rest is history.

The tests DO NOT RUN at the moment since we've moved massive sections out. These will be back in action shortly.
